Node.Js

It is a Backend  programming language that makes easier interactions between the Client  and the Server side. It also means that Node.js can handle a large number of concurrent connections without using a lot of system resources because it is built on V8 engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it very efficient for handling a large number of requests at the same time. This means that Node.js can handle a high volume of traffic without getting bogged down.

Advantages of using Node.js for backend development

a)Non blocking Input and output.
b)It is event driven
c)High performance.


How to install Node.js on a machine

a)Go to the official Node.js website and download the Windows Installer, and launch the Node.js installer.
b)Follow the prompts in the installer to complete the installation process.
c)After the installation,, open the Command Prompt.
d)Type "node -v" in the command prompt to check the command prompt should display the version number of Node.js which shows that it has been successfully installed.
e)To start using Node.js, you can create a new file with a ".js" extension and write your Node.js code in it. 

Node.js module system and how does it work

Node module is like a global variable that is used to to load modules using the "require" function 
Const module = require(“module”);
With this snippet, we are importing a module from file named module and it can be export as well using export.module keyword.

What are npm modules and how do you install them in your project.

The word NPM stands for node package manager which is a default package for node.js and it’s the module that is used to extend the functionality of Node.js applications by providing pre-built code that can be easily integrated into an application.
